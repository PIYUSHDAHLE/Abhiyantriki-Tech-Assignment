            <h1>Investor Relations</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Investor Relations (IR) function has seen a tremendous shift in its relevance and role
            with increased investor engagement, enhanced shareholder participation, and
            emergence of proxy advisory firms; all on the back of an enhanced focus on
            corporate governance. In line with this shift, the role of the Investor Relations Officer
            (IRO) has also undergone a change.
            </p>

            <p>Not only is the IRO responsible for the correct messaging to the investors and the
                financial community at large, he/she is also increasingly expected to provide industry
                insights due to his/her outward-facing role and access to the investors.</p>

                <p>These developments demand that the IROs act as the internal counsel for the Csuite executives at their respective companies further increasing their
                    responsibilities and broadening their profile. The IR function has the potential to
                    significantly enhance a company’s profile in the financial markets if backed by the
                    right business performance and intent. A highly effective IR function can truly
                    operate as the steward of optimum value for all stakeholders.
                    </p>

                    <p>Below are the findings of Investor Relations Strategic Enabler Survey
                        conducted on 91 companies by KPMG in India:</p>
